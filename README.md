# Work-day-planner

Assignment for this week was to create a daily planner, to create a schedule.
The planner had to have the date and time diplayed at the top.  There had to be time blocks and they had to be colour coded to indicate whether the event is in the past, present or future.
You are then able to select a time block and schedule an event and save the item even when the page is refreshed.

The project can be viewed on Github.com/SHAJLP/Work-day-planner and the live website can be viewed using link below.
